        ". What is a Decision Tree, and how does it work?\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values, with each split aiming to improve the homogeneity of the target variable in the resulting subsets. The tree structure consists of nodes, where each internal node represents a decision rule (split based on a feature), and the leaves represent the final output (classification or predicted value).\n",
        "\n",
        "Root Node: The starting point where the first split happens.\n",
        "Decision Nodes: Nodes where the data is split based on feature conditions.\n",
        "Leaf Nodes: Terminal nodes that represent the predicted output.\n",
        "The tree is built by recursively splitting the data until a stopping condition (like max depth or minimum samples) is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are impurity measures in Decision Trees?\n",
        "Impurity measures are used in Decision Trees to evaluate how well a particular split (or decision rule) separates the data. The goal is to split the data in a way that the subsets are as pure as possible, meaning each subset has one class (for classification) or similar values (for regression).\n",

        "In terms of usage, both Gini Impurity and Entropy lead to similar tree structures but may differ slightly in performance depending on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the mathematical explanation behind Decision Trees?\n",
        "The mathematical basis of Decision Trees involves recursive partitioning of the data set. The goal is to minimize the impurity measure (like Gini or Entropy) at each split, creating homogeneous subgroups. The algorithm chooses the feature that maximizes information gain (or minimizes impurity) at each node.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is Pre-Pruning in Decision Trees?\n",
        "Pre-Pruning (also known as early stopping) involves stopping the growth of the tree before it reaches its maximum depth. This is done to prevent overfitting by setting limits like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Maximum depth of the tree,\n",
        "Minimum number of samples required to split a node,\n",
        "Minimum impurity decrease required for further splits.\n",
        "9. What is Post-Pruning in Decision Trees?\n",
        "Post-Pruning (also known as cost complexity pruning) involves growing the full tree first and then removing branches that have little predictive power. This is typically done by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluating subtrees with a validation set,\n",
        "Pruning branches that do not improve performance.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning?\n",
        "Pre-Pruning prevents the tree from growing too complex by setting conditions during tree construction.\n",
        "Post-Pruning allows the tree to grow fully and then reduces its size based on performance evaluation.\n",
        "11. What is a Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
        "A Decision Tree Regressor is used for regression tasks. Instead of predicting class labels, it predicts continuous values by splitting the data based on feature values to minimize variance within the resulting subsets. It uses measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate splits.\n",

        "12. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Decision Trees?\n",
        "Advantages:\n",

        "Non-linear relationships between features can be captured.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n",
        "Sensitive to noisy data.\n",
        "Can be unstable with small changes in the data (due to high variance).\n",
        "13. How does a Decision Tree handle missing values?\n",
        "Decision Trees can handle missing values in a few ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Surrogate Splits: When the primary feature for splitting is missing, a surrogate feature is used.\n",
        "Ignoring Missing Values: Some implementations ignore missing data during the split calculation.\n",
        "Imputation: Missing values can be filled in using techniques like mean, median, or mode imputation before training.\n",
        "14. How does a Decision Tree handle categorical features?\n",
        "Decision Trees can handle categorical features by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Splitting based on specific category values.\n",
        "Treating categorical variables as a whole, creating binary splits or multi-way splits depending on the number of categories.\n",

Furthermore the goal of the\nresearch that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the\nimpact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the\nvalidity of this assumption.\n\nThe scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of\nthis dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate\nabout ethical issues in data science and machine learning.\n\nIn this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original\nsource::\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n\n    data_url = \"http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston\"\n    raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep=\"\\s+\", skiprows=22, header=None)\n    data = np.hstack([raw_df.values[::2, :], raw_df.values[1::2, :2]])\n    target = raw_df.values[1::2, 2]\n\nAlternative datasets include the California housing dataset and the\nAmes housing dataset. You can load the datasets as follows::\n\n    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n    housing = fetch_california_housing()\n\nfor the California housing dataset and::\n\n    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\n    housing = fetch_openml(name=\"house_prices\", as_frame=True)\n\nfor the Ames housing dataset.\n\n[1] M Carlisle.\n\"Racist data destruction?\"\n<https://medium.com/@docintangible/racist-data-destruction-113e3eff54a8>\n\n[2] Harrison Jr, David, and Daniel L.
